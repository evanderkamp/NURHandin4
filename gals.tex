\section{Spiral and elliptical galaxies}

For this question I could copy my leapfrog code from the working class without changes and the Euler I could easily change it to fit the problem by looking at the leapfrog code. 
Both the leapfrog algorithm and euler algorithm I made together with my sister Liz van der Kamp (s2135752) in the working class.

The code I wrote for this is:
